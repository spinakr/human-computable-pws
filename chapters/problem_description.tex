\noindent\textbf{Problem description:}

Managing passwords is a significant problem for most people in the modern world. This project will be based
around a recent paper proposing a method for humans to be able to re-compute passwords from public and
reliable storage. The first stage of this project will be to understand the scheme and compare it with related
methods and existing password management systems. After obtaining an decent understanding of the concepts of the scheme, the project will implement the system to be able to test its usefullness.


After this the project can develop in a number of
different ways including: implementing the system and testing its usefulness; designing variants and extensions
of the proposed model and construction; assessing the validity of the scheme by testing human behaviour.
