\chapter{Experiment}\label{ch:experiment}
This chapter will present the design and execution of an experiment trying to measure  the performance of the human computable password management scheme. The experiment is design as a web application implementing the scheme allowing participants to test how the scheme would work in practice while measuring how fast the computation is performed. The application thus acts as both a demonstration app and a tool for gathering performance data. It has four sections designed to help the participants understand the scheme and get familiar with the computation technique. First as demonstration video is displayed explaining how to compute a password from a challenge, then the user is asked to enter some demographic data. Next a practice section
