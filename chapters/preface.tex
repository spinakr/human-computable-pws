This report is the result of the master's project completed in the 10th semester of the Master's Program in Communication Technology at the Department of Telematics (ITEM) - Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

Throughout the work with the thesis, I have been able to learn a lot about both application development and password management schemes. Having a practical approach to the research has been both interesting and inspiring. 

\par I would like to thank my supervisor Professor Colin Boyd for all the help and guidance in regards to the project and the thesis. 

\par Finally I would like to thank Ingrid, for both help with proofreading the report and as a participant in the experiment. Thank you for 5 lovely years in Trondheim; you have been, and are, the most important person in my life.
