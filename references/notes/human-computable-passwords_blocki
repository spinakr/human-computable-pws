human-computable-passwords_blocki

#Summary
•Human memorize secret mapping and authenticate by computing responses f(m(Ci)) to challenge C where f is a easily computed function and m a secret mapping
•Security should be obtained after many breaches
•Persistent memory is typically a sticky note on the users desktop or similar, while associative memory is the memory of his head.
•Challenges can be stored persistently but the mapping must be only known by the user himself.

#Definitions
•For each account a m length password challenge is generated and stored in persistent memory accessible to both the user and the adversary. When logging in to a account the challenge is shown and the password computed as the series of responses.

#Requirements
•Human computable - human can compute it quickly in his head
   ◦Add → addition
   ◦Recall → recall mapping
   •TableLookup → take digit x and find corresponding x’th value from table.

#Authentication process
•Secret mapping are generated locally on the users computer, possibly with mnemonic helpers for memorization.
