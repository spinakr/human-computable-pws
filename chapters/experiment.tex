\chapter{Usability Experiment}\label{ch:experiment}
This chapter will present the design and execution of an experiment trying to measure  the performance of the human computable password management scheme. The experiment is design as a web application implementing the scheme allowing participants to test how the scheme would work in practice while measuring how fast the computation is performed. The application thus acts as both a demonstration app and a tool for gathering performance data. It has four sections designed to help the participants understand the scheme and get familiar with the computation technique. First as demonstration video is displayed explaining how to compute a password from a challenge, then the user is asked to enter some demographic data. Next is the practice section, where the user is supposed to practice doing the calculation until being able to solve challenges without error. Finally is the experiment part, which is timed and correctness monitored. After finishing the calculations the user will submit the data and can chose to continue doing more experiments. 
\section{Experiment Objective.}
\todo[inline]{Explain what the goal of the experiment is. What results I'm looking for/what the purpose is.}
\todo[inline]{NOTE: The experiment application is not only recording data, it works as a presentation of the scheme, trying to make it easy to understand so that most people should be able to use it. }

\section{Experiment Setup}
\todo[inline]{What data will be recorded, choices regarding the secret mapping etc.}
\todo[inline]{}

\subsection{Web Application}
\todo[inline]{Design and architecture of the web application}
\todo[inline]{Discuss if a similar application could be used as an actual password manager. What are the advantages/disadvantages versus the extension implementation. }


\subsection{Results}
\todo[inline]{Presentation of the results gather through the experiment (calculation time, failure rate etc. )}
\todo[inline]{Different plots of the data. Not sure what and how to plot the different data??}

\subsection{Discussion}
\todo[inline]{Discuss how the results fit in the usability model, plots $\hat t$ for the different participants}
\todo[inline]{What use cases would require a faster or slower calculation time?}
